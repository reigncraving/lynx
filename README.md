**Lynx** is a project of mine for creating GUI experience. It is completely done in **C#** and Visual Studio (except for the logo).

If you are interested in the magic behind it, you can review the code for the main form **[here](https://github.com/reigncraving/lynx/blob/master/Lynx/LynxForm.cs)**, or run it from **lynx.exe** in *Lynx/bin/Release/*

## What's inside?

In few words, this is a simple graphic editor based on MS Paint, with few additional functionalities.

You can **open**, **save** files, and create **new file** with custom canvas size:

There is also a basic **undo** and **redo** option:
