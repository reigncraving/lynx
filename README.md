**Lynx** is a project of mine for creating GUI experience. It is completely done in **C#** and **Visual Studio** (except for the logo).

If you are interested in the magic behind it, you can review the code for the main form **[here](https://github.com/reigncraving/lynx/blob/master/Lynx/LynxForm.cs)**, or run it from **lynx.exe** in *Lynx/bin/Release/*

## What's inside?

In few words, this is a simple graphic editor based on MS Paint, with few additional functionalities.

You can **open**, **save** files, and create **new file** with custom canvas size:

There is also a basic **undo** and **redo** option:

You can lock ar unlock the **toolbar** and move it above or to the right side of the program window.

By clicking on the color wheel with the **left mouse button** and move the cursor around, you can quickly choose color from the wheel, and even faster by clicking the **right mouse button** you can select color for the background (second main) color in the very same fashion.

Alternatively you can slide the **RGB** bars, or manually input the value in the color boxes. The radio buttons enables the current main color.

**Custom color** support - you can use the default MS panel and add custom colors, or clear them:

You can write **text**, create different **shapes** and **lines**. Every selected tool displays different control options. For some where are **border size**, as well as **fill color** and **height** and **width;

**the color pick** is used to "spin" the wheel and bars in the search for the desired color.
